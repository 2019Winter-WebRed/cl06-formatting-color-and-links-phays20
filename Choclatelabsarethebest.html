        <!-- Paragraph about puppy proofing -->
        <p>When adopting a puppy it's a huge responsibility. Look for a shelter or puppy farm like I did! My dog stryder is adorable and the best companion to have! Before you adopt make sure to pupy proof your house such as pickup all things dogs can chew on espically shoes, also close doors so he or she wont go places they are not supposed to. Always make sure to never leave food out, I learned my lesson! Make sure to walk your dog everyday becuase they can get very hyper trust me I know. Nothing is better than getting home and being showered with love from your pup!</p>
        
        <!-- Paragraph about affordability -->
        <p>And speaking for adorable.... did I add how cute they look in custom collars, sweaters, flowers, toys and doggie beds!! Ahh I cant get enough of how cute they are when they are so little. Make sure before hand that you set a price range you are comfortable with! you might have to go a little over on the price once you see how cute the puppies are!</p>
         
        <!-- Paragraph about giving puppies love -->
		<p>When you find your puppy and give them a forever home there is nothing like that same feeling! They will be there for you no matter what mine always is! </p>
